# doc-export: SendData
"""
Example that demonstrates sending binray data from Python to JS. The
``Model.send_data()`` mechanism can be a powerful tool to send
(scientific) data, especially for large amounts of data. The method
accepts bytes or a URL ("http://" or "https://") where the
data can be retrieved. At his point AJAX is used to retrieve the data.
In the future we might push the data over a dedicated binary websocket
for greater performance.

If you find that you have a property that is a large list of numbers, maybe
that should be considered data instead of a property. 

Exported apps that use ``send_data()` work, but only if they are served
(e.g. on a blog, readthedocs or S3), because browsers typically refuse
to load local files via AJAX.
