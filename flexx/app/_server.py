    Create a new server object. This is automatically called; users generally

    Flexx uses the notion of a single current server object. This function
    (re)creates that object. If there already was a server object, it is
    replaced. It is an error to call this function if the current server
    is still running.

    Arguments:
        host (str): The hostname to serve on. By default
            ``flexx.config.hostname`` is used. If ``False``, do not listen
            (e.g. when integrating with an existing Tornado application).
        port (int, str): The port number. If a string is given, it is
            hashed to an ephemeral port number. By default
            ``flexx.config.port`` is used.
        loop: A fresh (asyncio) event loop, default None (use current).
        backend (str): Stub argument; only Tornado is currently supported.
