"""
Base class for objects that live in both Python and JS. This basically
implements the syncing of properties and events.

Developer info:

Events are transparently handled accross the language barrier. Both sides
keep each-other informed for what events there are registered handlers, and
only those events are "synchronised". That way, a mouse move event does
not result in a lot of messages send to Python (unless there is a mouse move
handler in Python).

The Model class provides three ways for adding properties:

* a property defined at the Python side
* a property defined at the JS side
* a property defined at both sides (defined as part of Python class,
  but with flag `both=True`)

In the first two cases, a corresponding proxy property is created for
the other side. The property is settable at both ends (unless its a
readonly), but the property is validated where it is defined; the proxy
sends the new value to the other side, where validation takes places,
after which the normalized value is send back and set. The event for
setting a property is emitted by the properties directly, i.e. events
for properties are not "synchronised", but occur on both sides because
properties are synchronised.

In the situation where the `both` flag is used, validation occurs on
both sides. Such a property is directly validated and "applied" at the
side where it is set, and the value is synchronised to the other side,
where its again validated and set.

Properties are eventually synchronous. This means that they may become
out of sync, e.g. when set nearly at the same time in both JS and
Python, but will become equal after a certain time. In the first two
cases eventual synchronicity is naturally occuring because there is a
clear "reference" side. In the third case eventual synchronicity is
implemented by making Python the end-point: setting a property at the
JS side will also set it to the Python side, and setting a property at
the Python side will set the property in JS, which will set (again) in
Python. Note that setting a property with the same value will not cause
an event to be emitted.

The Python side was chosen as the end-point because at this side any
jitter from quickly updating properties generally has little side-effects,
while on the JS side you will see it occuring even for a slider. There
means to avoid jitter, but this complicates the code. We could add it
if it's found to be necessarty at a later time.

Properties can be explicitly marked to not sync. This can be used e.g.
in cases where it does not make sense to have the property value
available at the other side.

Most of the logic for determining when the setting-of-a-property must
be synchronised to the other ends is implemented in the ``_set_prop()``
methods.

Initialization of properties was a pain to get right. Without going
into too much detail, the ``init()`` method on both the Python and JS
side provide a means for subclasses to do initialization at a time when
the property values have their initial values, but handlers are not yet
initialized and events are not yet emitted. Therefore additional
attributes and handlers can be created here.

    """ Subclass of HasEvents representing Python-JavaScript object models.
    
    Each instance of this class has a corresponding object in
    JavaScript. Events are transparently handled accross the language
    barrier. To avoid unnecessary communication, only events for which
    there are handlers at the other side are synchronized.
    
    The JS version of this class is defined by the contained ``JS``
    class. One can define methods, properties, handlers, and (json
    serializable) constants on the JS class.
    
    One can also make use of a contained ``Both`` class to define things
    that will be present in both Python and JS. This is intended primarily
    for defining properties, which can be set on both ends, and which get
    automatically synchronised.
    
    The ``init()`` method on both the Python and JS side can be used
    to do initialization at a time when properties have their initial
    values, but handlers are not yet initialized and events are not yet
    emitted. When a Model instance is assigned as an attribute to the Python
    instance (inside the init() method), the corresponding attribute
    will also be present at the JavaScript side.
    
    Initialization order and life cycle:
    
    * An id and session are associated with the model.
    * The default/initial values for the properties are set.
    * The init() is called. You can get/set properties and attributes here.
    * The handlers are connected. You can use properties here, as well
      as attributes set in init(). Handlers connected to events that
      correspond to a property receive an event to communicate the
      initial value (unless that property does not have a value yet).
    * On the JavaScript side the same order applies. The creation of
      the JavaScript object occurs after the Python object is created.
    * The JavaScript part of a Model is not garbadge collected, but removed
      when the Python side object is deleted or disposed using dispose().
    * The Python part of a model is garbadge collected as usual. Note that
      handlers hold references to the objects that they connect to.
    * Note that the Widget class has a mechanism to avoid being deleted
      when it is temporarily not referenced due to jitter in the
      children property.
    
    Models can be used as a context manager to make new Model objects
    created inside such a context to share the same session. The ``init()``
    method is invoked in the context of the object itself.
    
    The typical way to use a model is do define properties (preferably
    in the Both "subclass") and events, and react to these by writing
    handlers at the side where the action should be taken. See the example
    below or many of the examples of the Flexx documentation.
    
    Parameters:
        session (Session, None): the session object that connects this
            instance to a JS client. If not given, will use the session
            of a currently active model (i.e. as a context manager).
        is_app (bool): whether this object is the main app object. Set
            by Flexx internally. Not used by the Model class, but can
            be used by subclasses.
        kwargs: initial property values (see HasEvents).
    
    Notes:
        This class provides the base object for all widget classes in
        ``flexx.ui``. However, one can also create subclasses that have
        nothing to do with user interfaces or DOM elements.
