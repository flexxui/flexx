Widgets are components
----------------------

Widgets are what we call "components", which are a central
part of the event system. They are what allows widgets to have properties
and react to things happening in other parts of the application. But
let's not get ahead of ourselves; the event system is dicsussed in the
next chapter.

For the moment, it's enough to know that the :class:`Widget <flexx.ui.Widget>`
class is kind of :class:`JsComponent <flexx.app.JsComponent>`.
This means that these widgets live in JavaScript: when their actions and methods
are called, they run in JavaScript. But the cool
thing is that you can still *use* these objects in Python, by setting their properties,
invoking their actions, and reacting to their state. This is possible because
of so-called proxy objects.

We mentioned earlier that the :class:`PyWidget <flexx.ui.PyWidget>` can be used to
create widgets that live in Python: these are a kind of :class:`PyComponent <flexx.app.PyComponent>`:
their actions and methods are executed in Python. And yes, they can be *used*
from JS by setting properties, invoking action and reacting to state.

Being able to write components (and widgets) that operate either
in Python or JavaScript is a very powerful feature of Flexx. However, it can
easily be a source of confusion. Therefore it's good to understand the
difference between these kinds of classes.


PyComponent and JsComponent
---------------------------

A Flexx application consists of components that exist in either Python or
JavaScript, and which can communicate with each-other in a variety of ways.

The :class:`PyComponent <flexx.app.PyComponent>` and
:class:`JsComponent <flexx.app.JsComponent>` classes derive from the
:class:`Component <flexx.event.Component>` class (which is a topic of the next chapter).
The most important things to know about ``PyComponent`` and ``JsComponent``:

* They are both associated with a :class:`Session <flexx.app.Session>`.
* They have an ``id`` attribute that is unique within their session,
  and a ``uid`` attribute that is globally unique.
* They live (i.e. their methods run) in Python and JavaScript, respectively.
* A ``PyComponent`` can only be instantiated in Python, a ``JsComponent`` can
  be instantiated in both Python and JavaScript.
* A ``PyComponent`` always has a corresponding proxy object in JavaScript.
* A ``JsComponent`` *may* have a proxy object in Python; these proxy objects
  are created automatically when Python references the component.

In practice, you'll use ``PyComponents`` to implement Python-side behavior,
and ``JsComponents`` (e.g. Widgets) for the behavior in JavaScript. Flexx
allows a variety of ways by which you can tie Python and JS together, but
this can be a pitfall. It's important to think well about what parts of your
app operate in JavaScript and what in Python. Patterns which help you do this
are discussed later in the guide.

(And the plain :class:`Component <flexx.event.Component>` class? It can be
used (both in Python and JS), but is unaware of anything "on the other side".
It's use in Flexx is therefore limited.)


Proxy components
----------------

The proxy components allow the "other side" to inspect properties, invoke
actions and connect to events. The real component is aware of what events
the proxy reacts to, and will only communicate these events.

The example below may be a bit much to digest. Don't worry about that.
In most cases things should just work.

.. code-block:: py

    from flexx import flx

    class Person(flx.JsComponent):  # Lives in Js
        name = flx.StringProp(settable=True)
        age = flx.IntProp(settable=True)

        @flx.action
        def increase_age(self):
            self._mutate_age(self.age + 1)

    class PersonDatabase(flx.PyComponent):  # Lives in Python
        persons = flx.ListProp()

        @flx.action
        def add_person(self, name, age):
            with self:  # new components need a session
                p = Person(name=name, age=age)
            self._mutate_persons([p], 'insert', 99999)

        @flx.action
        def new_year(self):
            for p in self.persons:
                p.increase_age()


In the above code, the ``Person`` objects live in JavaScript, while a
database object that keeps a list of them lives in Python. In practice,
the ``Person`` components will e.g. have a visual representation in the
browser. The database could also have been a ``JsComponent``, but let's
assume that we need it in Python because it synchronizes to a mysql
database or something.

We can observe that the ``add_person`` action (which executes in Python)
instantiates new ``Person`` objects. Actually, it instantiates proxy objects that
automatically get corresponding (real) ``Person`` objects in JavaScript.
The ``new_year`` action executes in Python, which in turn invokes the ``increase_age``
action of each person, which execute in JavaScript.


Actions and events cross the boundary
-------------------------------------

It's important to realize that actions of a component can be invoked from anywhere.
In the above example, ``Person.set_name("Guido")`` can be called from
Python (e.g. by the ``PersonDatabase``).

Similarly, you can use reactions to listen for changes on components,
no matter whether these components live in Python or JavaScript.
As an example, let's implement a personcounter (reactions are covered
later in this guide):


.. code-block:: py

    class PersonCounter(flx.JsComponent):

        def init(self, db):
            self.db = db
            # now we can call self.db.add_person() from JavaScript!

        @flx.reaction
        def _count(self):
            print("There are", len(self.db.persons), "persons")

    # To instantiate (e.g. inside PersonDatabase.init())
    PersonCounter(database)

    # Note that we can also invoke the db's actions from here!


The root component and active components
----------------------------------------

Another useful feature is that each component has a ``root`` attribute that
holds a reference to the component representing the root of the application.
E.g. if the root is a ``PersonDatabase``, all ``JsComponent`` objects have a
reference to (a proxy of) this database.

Further, when a component is used as a context manager, it becomes an
"active component". We've already seen how this is used to structure
child widgets. Sometimes you may want to know which components are active,
which you can do with :func:`loop.get_active_component <flexx.event.Loop.get_active_component>`
and :func:`loop.get_active_components <flexx.event.Loop.get_active_components>`.
