Contributing to Flexx
---------------------

If you like Flexx and want to help out, there's a few things you can do.
First off, feedback; it's very useful to hear what you like and what you
struggle with. Feel free to use the
`Github issue tracker <https://github.com/flexxui/flexx/issues>`_ for this.

You can help by contributing to the documentation, and/or by creating nice
examples.

If you would like to help out with the codebase itself, e.g. by fixing bugs,
making improvements, or submitting new types of widgets, you probably need
to a few extra libraries (don't worry, it's 'nothing fancy):

* pytest and pytest-cov (get them via conda or pip)
* flake8 (get it via conda or pip)
* Nodejs
* Firefox

We follow the Github workflow:

* You fork the `Github repo <https://github.com/flexxui/flexx>`_ and make a clone
  to your local computer.
* You update to the latest version: ``git checkout master && git pull``
* You make a new branch: ``git checkout -b mywork``
* You make changes to the code and commit these: ``git commit``
* You push to your fork ``git push``
* Create a Pull Request from the Github interface.
