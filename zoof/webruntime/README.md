The purpose of the webruntime subpackage is to provide a means to launch
a web runtime that looks and feels as a desktop application. There is
support for multiple web runtimes, such as xul, nw.js, pyqt-webkit, and
possibly more in the future. The best supported one is Mozilla's xul,
since it is widely available (everywhere where Firefox is installed),
can be made available via a portable download (xulrunner), and is
lightweight compared to some other runtimes.
