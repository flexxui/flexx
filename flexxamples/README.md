# Flexxamples

This package/directory contains the examples for the Flexx UI library. The
examples are divided in three categories. Most examples (in particular the
ones in `demos`) can be imported and used as widgets in larger apps, or
served alongside your main app. Each example can also be run as a script.

Example notebooks are available at https://github.com/flexxui/flexx-notebooks
