"""
Example showing running Flexx' event loop in another thread.
This is not a recommended use in general.

Invoking actions is thread-safe. Actions and reactions are always
executed in the thread that runs the event loop.

The flx.create_server() is used to (re)create the server object. It is
important that the used asyncio loop is local to the thread.
